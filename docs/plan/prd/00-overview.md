## Executive Summary

**Ralph-as-a-Service (RaaS)** is a desktop application powered by the Claude Agent SDK that implements Geoffrey Huntley's "Ralph" technique at scale. It provides a beautiful, real-time visualization interface for managing multiple AI coding agent projects running in parallel.

### Vision

Transform the simple `while :; do cat PROMPT.md | agent ; done` concept into an enterprise-grade, visually stunning desktop application that allows developers to:

- Run multiple Ralph loops in parallel across different projects
- Visualize agent swarms and their interconnections in real-time
- Monitor individual agent progress, outputs, and decision-making
- Manage task queues and project pipelines
- Optimize costs and token usage across all running agents

### Key Differentiators

1. **Visual Agent Orchestration** - See your agents work, not just their outputs
2. **Multi-Project Parallelization** - Run dozens of Ralph loops simultaneously
3. **Real-Time Agent Graph** - Beautiful force-directed visualization of agent relationships
4. **Click-to-Inspect** - Drill down into any agent to see its current state
5. **SPARC Integration** - Built-in support for SPARC methodology workflows
